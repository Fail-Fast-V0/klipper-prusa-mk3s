# Prusa MK3s Klipper Config

# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment 
# the files and/or settings you need.

# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:

# 0) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html
# 1) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# 2) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/skew_correction.html
# 3) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html

#z_offset = 1.7 #the smooth sheet is 1.7mm and is the baseline with 0.0mm for z-offset. Only use the Z-offset for additional sheets

## For faster printing enable

## For stealth mode enable

# [tmc2130 stepper_y]
# interpolate: True
# stealthchop_threshold: 80
# [tmc2130 stepper_z]
